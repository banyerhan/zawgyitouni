**Another Zawgyi <=> Unicode Converter**

### Author: [Banyer Han](https://nightfury.info)

## Info

Zawgyi to Unicode has been written in [2018](https://github.com/banyerhan/zawgyitouni). Now, unicode to zawgyi has been finished.

### Why another converter ?

When I was writting [ZG2uni](https://github.com/banyerhan/zawgyitouni) , I need to use for [MYSTERY ZILLION](http://www.mysteryzillion.org) for converting the whole database to Unicode. So, I wrote ZG2Uni (of course , it has some bugs and some rule missing). 

> I cannot promise , it's correct 100% after converting.

> If you are not using in app or program and just for converting the text , please use [Parabaik](https://github.com/banyerhan/zawgyitouni)
